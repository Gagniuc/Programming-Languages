//Additional algorithm 30. It shows the use of functions by considering complex arguments. Such complex arguments can be strings, array variables, or complex objects. In this specific case, a string and an array variable are used as arguments to a function called "compute". An array variable containing five elements is declared using string literals. Then a string variable t is declared and set to empty. The two variables are passed to the "compute" function. Inside the "compute" function, a for-loop traverses each element of the array a, and it adds the value from it to the accumulator variable t. At the end of the for-loop, the "compute" function returns the value of t, which is assigned to a string variable b, that is further printed onto the output for inspection. Note that the source code is in context and works with copy/paste.
