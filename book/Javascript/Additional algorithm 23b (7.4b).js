//Additional algorithm 7.4b. It demonstrates the traversal of a one-dimensional array. An array variable is declared with string literals. The implementation also uses two other variables. A variable t stores string values and is initially set to empty. Another variable (ie. i) initialized with value zero is the counter of a while-loop. The while-loop traverses the elements of array A by using the counter i as an index. At each iteration, the value from an element is added together with other string characters to the variable t. Once the end of the while-loop cycle is reached, the value collected in the variable t is printed in the output for inspection. Note that the source code is in context and works with copy/paste.
