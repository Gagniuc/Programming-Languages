# Programming Languages

This work is an introductory textbook in several computer languages. It describes the most well-known and popular programming environments such as: C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, PERL, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Visual Basic (VB) or Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Therefore, the main objective of this unique guide is to provide code examples reflected in these nine computer languages. Readers can easily understand the connection and universality between the syntax of different environments and be adept at translating code. This learning experience can be ideal for upper-undergraduate introductory courses, researchers, doctoral students, and sociologists or engineers charged with implementing data analysis. Graphical illustrations are used for technical details about the computation examples to aid in an in-depth understanding of their inner workings. Moreover, the book contains original material that has been class-tested by the author and numerous cases are examined. Readers will also benefit from the inclusion of: 

- Historical and philosophical perspectives on the past, present and future of computer languages. 
- A total of 448 additional files freely available online, from which a total of 44 files are poster presentations (i.e. PowerPoint and PDF files). 
- A total of 404 code examples reflected in nine computer languages, namely: C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, PERL, PHP, Python, Ruby and VB.

This work first begins with a general introduction to history and presents the natural inevitable pathway from mechanical automatons to present electronic computers. Following this historical introduction, an in-detail look is made on philosophical questions, implementations, entropy and life. More often than not, there is a genuine amazement of the younger generations regarding the advancement of computer technology. Historical events that led to the development of technologies have been distilled down to the essence. However, the essence of any story is made with massive loss of detailed information. The essence of essences even more so. Over time, the lack of detail leads to a collective amnesia that can prevent us from understanding the naturalness by which technology has evolved. Thus, new constructs are always built upon older constructs to fit the evolutionary chain of technological progress, which boils down to the same fundamental rules as biological evolution. In the first stage, this book discusses the natural path of programming constructs by starting from time immemorial and ending with examples up to the present times. In the end, naturally driven constructs of all kinds also drive our society today. In the second part, the emphasis is made on the technical side where a total of nine computer languages are used simultaneously for mirrored examples. Simultaneous learning of multiple computer languages can be regarded as an asset in the world of science and technology. Thus, the reader can get used to the majority of known programming or scripting languages. Moreover, a basic knowledge of software implementation in several computer languages, even in an introductory way, helps the versatility and adaptability of the reader to new situations that may arise in industry, education, or research. Thus, this work is meant to bring a more concrete understanding of the similarities and differences between computer languages.
