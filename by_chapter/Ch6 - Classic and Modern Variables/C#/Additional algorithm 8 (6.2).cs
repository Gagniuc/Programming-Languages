//Additional algorithm 6.2. It shows how values (literals) of different data types are assigned to variables. Please note that C#, Java and VB use the data type explicitly, i.e. the type of the variable is declared before assignment. On the other hand, notice that all the other environments use implicit data type, that is, the value is able to explicitly declare the variable type. Judging by the trends, it is possible that in the future explicit assignments may be less frequent. Note that the source code is in context and works with copy/paste.
